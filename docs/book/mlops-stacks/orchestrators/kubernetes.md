description: How to orchestrate pipelines with Kubernetes
---

The Kubernetes orchestrator is an [orchestrator](./orchestrators.md) flavor provided with
the ZenML `kubernetes` integration that runs your pipelines on a 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

## When to use it

You should use the Kubernetes orchestrator if:
* you're looking lightweight way of running your pipelines on Kubernetes.
* you don't need a UI to list all your pipelines runs.
* you're not willing to maintain [Kubeflow Pipelines](./kubeflow.md)
on your Kubernetes cluster.
* you're not interested in paying for managed solutions like [Vertex](./gcloud-vertexai.md).

## How to deploy it

The Kubernetes orchestrator requires a Kubernetes cluster in order to run.
There are many ways to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using different cloud providers
or on your custom infrastructure and we can't possibly cover all of them, 
but you can check out our cloud guide [ZenML Cloud Guide](../../stack-deployment-guide/overview.md)
for some complete stack deployments which use the Kubernetes orchestrator.

## How to use it

To use the Kubernetes orchestrator, we need:
* The ZenML `kubernetes` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run 
    ```shell
    zenml integration install kubernetes
    ```
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed.
* A [remote artifact store](../artifact-stores/artifact-stores.md) as part of your stack.
* A [remote metadata store](../metadata-stores/metadata-stores.md) as part of your stack.
If you want to use a MySQL database deployed in your Kubernetes cluster, you can use
the [Kubernetes metadata store](../metadata-stores/kubernetes.md). For a more 
production-ready setup we suggest using a [MySQL metatadata store](../metadata-stores/mysql.md) instead.
* A [remote container registry](../container-registries/container-registries.md) as part of your stack.
* A Kubernetes cluster [deployed](#how-to-deploy-it) and the name
of your Kubernetes context which points to this cluster. Run 
`kubectl config get-contexts` to see a list of available contexts.

We can then register the orchestrator and use it in our active stack:
```shell
zenml orchestrator register <NAME> \
    --flavor=kubernetes \
    --kubernetes_context=<KUBERNETES_CONTEXT>

# Add the orchestrator to the active stack
zenml stack update -o <NAME>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
ZenML will build a Docker image called `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME>`
which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in Kubernetes. Check out
[this page](../../developer-guide/advanced-usage/docker.md)
if you want to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and
how you can customize them.
{% endhint %}

You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Kubernetes orchestrator:
```shell
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

A concrete example of using the Kubernetes orchestrator can be found 
[here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/kubernetes_orchestration).
